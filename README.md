I'm Afnan! Most folks call me that in real life, so you may too. Online, I'm known as Vuc (formerly Vucirrha, but most have difficulty pronouncing that). I'm Malaysian, and I'm studying in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My favorite Pokémon is Vulpix, and more generally, my favorite animal is the red fox!

Bear with me! I have a lot to learn, and there's so much I want to do.
