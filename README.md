I'm Afnan! I'm Malaysian, and I'm studying in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My favorite Pokémon is Vulpix, and more generally, my favorite animal is the fox!

Bear with me! I have a lot to learn, and there's so much I want to do.

My preferred way of being contacted is just by [email](afnanfdz@gmail.com).
